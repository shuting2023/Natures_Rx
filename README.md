# Natures_Rx
An Analysis of Urban Green Spaces features and their Effect on Mental Wellbeing

## Description
Our project aims to examine the influence of green spaces in urban areas on mental health, recognizing the benefits these areas provide, such as stress reduction and improved mood. The urgency of this research is underscored by increasing urbanization and rising mental health issues. 

Objectives:

* How do green spaces in urban environments affect mental health levels (e.g., depression, anxiety)?
* What is the relationship between socioeconomic status and access to green spaces, and how does this affect mental health?
* How do different natural environments (e.g., beach vs. forest) influence urban greenness?
* What is the impact of temperature and seasonal changes on mental health?
