An Analysis of Urban Green Spaces and their Effect on Mental Wellbeing

## Project Summary
Our project aims to examine the influence of green spaces in urban areas on mental health, recognizing the benefits these areas provide, such as stress reduction and improved mood. The urgency of this research is underscored by increasing urbanization and rising mental health issues. The project also reflects personal motivations from our team members, including Denesh's observations of green space implementation in cities like Singapore, and Shuting's concern over the prevalence and private nature of mental disorders in the U.S. Natalie's personal experiences also highlight the significant mental health improvements associated with high greenness environments.

The research questions we aim to address include:

* How do green spaces in urban environments affect mental health levels (e.g., depression, anxiety)?
* What is the relationship between socioeconomic status and access to green spaces, and how does this affect mental health?
* How do different natural environments (e.g., beach vs. forest) influence urban greenness?
* What is the impact of temperature and seasonal changes on mental health?

We plan to compare cities with similar demographics, focusing on factors like population size, income, and density, to understand the role of the natural environment on mental health and communicate our findings effectively.
